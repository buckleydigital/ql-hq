-- Remove the 10-lead pack entirely and standardise on five packs:
-- 25, 50, 100, 200, 300. This replaces the tier set seeded in
-- 20260524000001. Orders snapshot quantity + discount at purchase time and do
-- not reference tier ids, so clearing and re-seeding is safe. The /admin
-- discount editor reads this table live, so it reflects the new set with no
-- code change.
